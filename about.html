<p>ABOUT DecDec BINGO:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;DecDec Bingo&quot; online BINGO cards were created as an excercise in coding. Version 0 was written in a few hours on the day of December Decadence, 2011. It was only tested in Safari on an iPad 2 and the Firefox web browser on a Windows computer. It worked (albeit with some known issues) and took the place of many physical BINGO cards that night.</p>

<p>The original &quot;DecDec Bingo&quot; webpage did not include the &quot;BINGO&quot; title row which caused some confusion for some players.</p>

<p>One known (to the creator) issue was that if the webpage were to be swapped out of memory, the BINGO card would be lost. Unfortunately, one person did suffer from this.</p>

<p>For DecDec 2012, a method to restore the state of the card after a reload was added. In 2011, the &quot;New Card&quot; button was tiny, easily pressed, and did not ask for confirmation when activated; this was fixed for 2012. Also, the &quot;BINGO&quot; title row was added.</p>

<p>DecDec 2013 saw a minor revamp to correct some squashed rows caused by adding the &quot;BINGO&quot; title row but failing to adjust the row heights in 2012.</p>

<p>DecDec 2014 added an alert when the state of the card was unable to be stored (generally in &quot;Private&quot; or &quot;Incognito&quot; mode).</p>

<p>For DecDec 2015, the pseudo-random number generator in use was changed as 2014 saw a large number of simultaneous BINGOs and &quot;blackout&quot;s.</p>

<p>For DecDec 2016, this &quot;about&quot; page, a &quot;help&quot; page, an &quot;(in)FAQ&quot; page, and a &quot;contact&quot; page were added.</p>
