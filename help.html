<p>HELP for playing DecDec BINGO:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Never played? Just not sure how? We're here to help. It's as easy as 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>

<p>1: Grab a card -- either physical or virtual -- and some markers (if playing on a physical card).</p>

<p>2: Listen for the numbers to be called.</p>

<p>3: If a called number is on your card, mark it.</p>

<p>4: If you get &quot;BINGO&quot;, &quot;Four Corners&quot;, or &quot;Blackout&quot; call it out (see below for what those mean).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE:</p>

<p>The center square is special: You get to use that square for &quot;free&quot;. It can be used for &quot;BINGO&quot; on either of the diagonals, the center row, or the center (&quot;N&quot;) column.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WAYS TO WIN:</p>

<p>&quot;BINGO&quot;: All five numbers in a single row, single column, or one of the diagonals.</p>

<p>&quot;Four Corners&quot;: The four numbers in the corners of the board.</p>

<p>&quot;Blackout&quot;: All the numbers on the board + &quot;free&quot;.</p>

<p>You may only win one of each kind of prize. (NOTE: This rule is subject to change without notice)</p>

<p>You may need to bring a special prize for the &quot;Blackout&quot; prize pool to be eligible to win a &quot;Blackout&quot; prize.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT'S UP WITH THE NUMBERS?</p>

<p>The pool of numbers to be called consists of those (base 10) numbers from 1 through 75 (inclusive) broken down into groups of 15.</p>

<p>Column &quot;B&quot;: 1-15<br />
Column &quot;I&quot;: 16-30<br />
Column &quot;N&quot;: 31-45<br />
Column &quot;G&quot;: 46-60<br />
Column &quot;O&quot;: 61-75<br />
