# DecDecBingo
DecDecBingo was originally created in 2011 as an exercise in coding; it was the author's first foray into CSS and JavaScript.

It's usually hosted on the author's provider's webserver, but there have been requests to put it on GitHub.

Here it now is.

The version advertised at DecDec will remain hosted on the author's provider's server, but additions that people offer up here may be incorporated there.
