# DecDecBingo
DecDecBingo was originally created in 2011 as an exercise in coding; it was the author's first foray into CSS and JavaScript.

It's usually hosted on my provider's webserver, but there have been requests to put it on GitHub.

I finally got around to that.

The version advertised at DecDec will reamin hosted on my provider's server, but I may incorporate additions that people offer up here.
