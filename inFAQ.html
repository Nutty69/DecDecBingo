<p>DecDec BINGO (in)FAQ -- (in)Frequently Asked Questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q: Why does this page look like crud?<br />
A: Because I'm not a web designer.</p>

<p>Q: No, seriously, your BINGO card looks sweet, what's up?<br />
A: Seriously, I'm not a web designer. My background is in database management, technical theater (stagehand, sound op, light op, and lighting design), as well as shipping/receiving & inventory management. If you want to donate your time and talent and send me some CSS and/or HTML that will make a &quot;pretty&quot; version of this page, please do: bingo@rgreen.org.</p>

<p>Q: Who are you?<br />
A: I am the &quot;BINGO King&quot; according to the eVite invitation.</p>

<p>Q: How do I play DecDec BINGO?<br />
A: Just like regular BINGO.</p>

<p>Q: But I've never played BINGO before, how do I play?<br />
A: Check out the <a href="help.html" target="_blank">&quot;Help&quot;</a> page.</p>

<p>Q: What should I do if I'm using the web version of DecDec BINGO and accidentally tap or click a number that wasn't called?<br />
A: Just tap or click it again and no one will be the wiser.</p>

<p>Q: Why can't I play DecDec BINGO if my browser is in "Private" or "Incognito" mode?<br />
A: The card uses localstorage to store data about the card layout and which numbers you've marked. Unfortunately, this is unavailable in most browsers' "Private" and "Incognito" modes. If you want to submit ideas for how to handle this situation without invoking server-side scripting or storage (restrictions imposed by my hosting provider), please let me know using the "Contact" form link on the DecDec BINGO card page.</p>

<p>Q: If a number is called that completes more than one BINGO on my card at the same time do I get one prize for each BINGO?<br />
A: Sadly, no :-( One &quot;regular&quot; BINGO prize per person per year. But, you can try for &quot;Blackout&quot; (and maybe &quot;Four Corners&quot; depending on the rules this year).</p>

<p>Q: What happens if I mark the numbers in all of the four corners on my card?<br />
A: You might be allowed to claim a special &quot;Four Corners&quot; prize.</p>

<p>Q: What happens if I mark all of the numbers on my card?<br />
A: If you brought a &quot;Blackout BINGO&quot; prize, you may yell &quot;BLACKOUT!&quot; and step on up and claim a prize from the special prize pool.</p>
